# E-LEARNING-PLATFORM-UI
*COMPANY* : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME* : ANUSHA ADDYOLA

*INTERN ID* : CT04DL81

*DOMAIN* : FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION* : 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR* : NEELA SANTHOSH

*DESCRIPTION* : 
This project involved designing and developing a visually appealing, interactive, and responsive front-end interface for an e-learning platform using standard web development tools and practices. The interface was created entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional) in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment. The platform includes multiple pages and covers essential features expected from a modern digital learning interface.

üõ† Tools & Technologies Used:
HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language):
HTML was used to build the basic structure of all pages. Each section such as the navigation bar, course list, video section, and progress tracker was created using HTML semantic tags like <section>, <nav>, <div>, and <iframe> for embedding media.

CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS was used extensively to style all HTML elements and create an engaging purple-themed UI. Advanced styling techniques such as hover effects, flexbox layout, custom buttons, rounded cards, and progress bars were used to enhance interactivity and aesthetics.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
VS Code was the primary IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used for writing code. It provided powerful features like syntax highlighting, extensions (e.g., Live Server), and easy file management that helped in quickly building and previewing the application.

Live Server Extension (VS Code):
This extension enabled real-time viewing of changes in the browser, improving development speed and feedback.

YouTube Embed (iframe):
To simulate course content delivery, an actual video from YouTube was embedded using an <iframe>. This gives users the ability to stream educational content directly from the application.

üìë Platform Features Developed:
Homepage:
A welcoming introduction with a clear call-to-action (Explore Courses) using a stylish button and brief platform description.

Course Listing Page:
A dynamic list of courses displayed using responsive cards. Each course card includes the title, a brief description, and a "Watch" button linking to the video page. This replicates how modern e-learning platforms present courses to users.

Progress Tracking Page:
This page uses animated progress bars to visually indicate a learner‚Äôs completion percentage for each course. This is a critical feature for users to stay motivated and track their progress.

Video Page:
A full-page dedicated to streaming course videos. The embedded YouTube video simulates a real learning module. Users can watch, pause, and resume the video, making the platform functional for actual content consumption.

Navigation Bar:
A consistent sticky navbar on all pages allows users to move between Home, Courses, Progress, and Video pages seamlessly. It‚Äôs styled with a deep purple background and interactive hover effects, reflecting modern design standards.

üåê Platform & Application Areas:
This project is purely front-end and can be used as a template for real-world e-learning platforms. It can be:

Integrated into larger learning management systems (LMS)

Used for portfolio showcases by developers

A prototype for educational startups or institutions

Extended into full-stack applications by adding a back-end (Node.js, Firebase, Django, etc.)

The platform can serve educational institutions, online coaching classes, tutorial sites, or individual educators wanting to share structured content online.

It also serves as a foundational project for understanding UI/UX design, multi-page website navigation, and frontend development best practices. The color palette (purple tones), smooth transitions, and card-based layouts were chosen to ensure a modern, clean, and professional user experience.

‚úÖ Conclusion:
This task not only fulfilled all functional deliverables (course list, progress tracker, video embedding) but also demonstrated how to use basic web technologies to build a visually impressive and user-friendly interface. The project reflects strong front-end development skills and provides a base that can be scaled into a full-featured e-learning application.
